# POC Getting Started Guide

## Timeline

Snyk POCs typically run for 1 or 2 weeks, with a few key milestones along the way.

### Week 0

Ahead of the POC Kickoff call, we will define success criteria and identify the key workflows that will be tested during the POC. During this prep phase, it is important to identify who will be involved in testing (e.g. developers, managers, security) and what will be in scope. I typically recommend identifying a subset of repositories that provide a representative sample of what exists across the organization.
