# POC Getting Started Guide

## Timeline

Snyk POCs typically run for 1 or 2 weeks, with a few key milestones along the way.

### POC Planning

Ahead of the POC Kickoff call, we will define success criteria and identify the key workflows that will be tested during the POC. During this prep phase, it is important to identify who will be involved in testing (e.g. developers, managers, security) and what will be in scope. I typically recommend identifying a subset of repositories that provide a representative sample of what exists across the organization.

Things to prepare:
- Create a free Snyk account at https://app.snyk.io/login
- Define Success Criteria
- Identify who will be involved in testing
- Identify what repositories will be imported

### POC Kickoff

During the POC Kickoff we will review the success criteria, set dates for our check-in and wrap-up calls, and get the team integrated with their Git repos. Based on the success criteria, we will create a checklist for the remainder of the POC.

Sample POC Checklist:
- [Importing Repos to Snyk](importing-repos.md)
- [Testing PR Checks](pr-checks.md)
- [Fixing Issues locally using the CLI and IDE](fixing-issues.md)
- [Automation in CI](running-in-cd.md)
- Review findings for accuracy
- Review reports for completeness

### POC Check-in

The check-in call happens at the mid-point of the POC, and will be used as an open forum to ask any tech-related questions and review the POC checklist. Additional check-ins can be scheduled as needed, and questions can be asked ad-hoc over Slack and email.

### POC Wrap-up

During the wrap-up we will go through any remaining tech questions, review the POC and success criteria, and declare a win/loss. If it makes sense, we will then discuss next steps.
